<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a Certified Public Procurement Officer (CPPO, CPPB, NIGP-CPP) on a mission to modernize the public sector. 
  With over 15 years of experience navigating complex regulatory environments—including six years dedicated to high-stakes 
  public procurement—I specialize in bridging the gap between rigid government policy and rapid technological innovation. 
  I don’t just manage contracts; I orchestrate solutions. I have led 18 major solicitations and oversaw hundreds of contract 
  actions, but my true passion lies in driving the adoption of cutting-edge tech, having managed solicitations for AI-powered 
  infrastructure analysis, automated translation systems, and enterprise generative AI chatbots.</p>

<p>I realized that to truly revolutionize government operations, I needed to understand the code behind the contracts. That is 
  why I am aggressively expanding my skillset beyond procurement, diving deep into a comprehensive technical stack that includes 
  Full-Stack Web Development, Python, Data Science, and AI Engineering. This portfolio documents my evolution from buying technology 
  to building it. My goal is to develop "GovTech" solutions—like an AI-powered scope writer—that streamline the bureaucratic process 
  and let public servants focus on what matters.</p>

<p>Off the clock, I channel my energy into martial arts. I am currently dedicated to learning Capoeira, building on a diverse 
  foundation in Taekwondo, BJJ, Karate, and Krav Maga. I’m also a family man and an ENTJ-A "Commander" personality, which means 
  I’m wired to seek out challenges. Whether I’m debugging code, negotiating a complex scope of work, or training in the roda, I 
  am always looking for the next system to optimize. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy seeing what I'm building.</p>
