<h1>The Best Movies According to Ryan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Chef</h3>
<p>This is a great feel-good movie that I love to re-watch when I need a pick-me-up.</p>
<h3>MCU Movies</h3>
<p>I'm a comic book nerd and, for better or worse, the MCU has had a massive impact on cinema.</p>
<h3>Conjuring Movies</h3>
<p>I'm also a fan of horror movies and the Conjuring movies have done for horror movies what the MCU did for all of cinema.</p>
